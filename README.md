# SSR App Cards

React Server-Side Rendering Example.

## Development

-   Clone the repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vFlicker/ssr-app-cards
```

-   Go to the project directory and install dependencies:

```bash
$ cd ssr-app-cards && npm install
```

Launch the server:

```bash
$ npm run start
```

Now, the application is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
The homepage is Sever Rendered and ['/client'](http://localhost:3000/client) is client side rendered.

### Note

This tutorial is to help you understand the concept behind server side rendering of a React application.
Don't use this in Production.
